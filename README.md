# Zollstock
A type-safe zero overhead compile-time physical units C++17 library.

Zollstock is German for folding rule. It's a funny word, because it's a lie. Zoll means inch but the so called Zollstock normaly shows meters these days.

The library is still in a very early development stage. So please be carefull when using it in production code.
Currently there is support for length, time and angle units and combinations of them.
